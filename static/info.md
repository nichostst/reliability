<summary>ℹ️ Developer's notes</summary>

<br>

Hello and welcome to this web application! This interface is completely built on the Python project *Streamlit*, check their docs and awesome work [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/).

This app is a one-stop solution to asset maintenance... in the making **so** stay tuned for exciting new features. You can also help to contribute or make feature requests at the Github
repository linked below. That said, I am not planning to over-engineer this application in terms of design and interface for the purpose it serves - goes with Streamlit design statement of simplicity - so sorry about that!

I am just a lone statistician-turned-developer so any suggestion or kind words is highly appreciated. Hope it is useful and happy exploring ;)

The code is available in the [repository](https://github.com/nichostst/reliability).
