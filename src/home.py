    st.markdown('''Allows the user to provide self-collected failure data and
                fit well-known statistical distributions to learn the
                underlying failure process in presence of censoring. This
                allows the user to experiment with time-based maintenance to
                improve system reliability, and save costs by proactively doing
                regular preventive maintenance as opposed to reactively fixing
                failures as they come. It also comes with a simulation platform
                to enable the user to gauge the uncertainty for analysis in
                shorter time periods.''')

    If the assets are replaced every time it fails, it will satisfy this
    assumption, no worries!
    2. Operating hours and operating conditions of the assets are the same
    across the whole system.''')

    st.header('Workflow')
    st.markdown('''   1. Input failure data at the `Fitter` page to learn the
    distribution of the failure process. If you do not have the data, you may
    generate a toy data by supplying the parameters, or skip to the step 2.
    2. On the `Maintenance` page, you will be able to input the learned (if you
    do step 1, else you can still plug and play with the parameters) failure
    process with the parameters on the sidebar. Important to note is the
    maintenance interval length parameter, which is the crux of our analysis.
    **Do take note of the additional assumption.**
    3. Input the estimated/expected costs of a maintenance action on the asset
    and the estimated/expected costs of a failure. A table will show at the
    bottom of the page showing the costs given the maintenance interval set at
    the sidebar. It will also show the cost-optimized length of the maintenance
    interval.
    4. In case the estimate of the uncertainty is needed, users may proceed to
    the `Simulation` page to simulate maintenance within a user-specified time
    period. **Note that the assumption in step 2 is made optional by allowing
    user to choose the maintenance type.** The choice `Component-wise` reflects
    said assumption. The simulation data may be downloaded to allow users to
    conduct their own analysis that is not covered by the application. The
    bottom of the page will show the uncertainty as distributions.''')

    st.markdown('''There are **two** maintenance types implemented:''')
    st.markdown('''   1. *Component-wise*: Maintains asset when it reaches a
    *mileage*, or time since last maintenance equal to the user-given interval.
    Once maintenance is done, the timer is reset to 0 for that asset only.
    2. *Fleetwide*: Whenever the system reaches *mileage* equal to the
    user-given interval, the whole system is maintained, regardless of time
    to last failures of individual assets.''')
